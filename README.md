# 🌎📊 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐔.𝐒. 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 (𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟔-𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟎) 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 📈🌱
* Excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I dove into a comprehensive dataset detailing air pollution across the 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟔 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟎. Leveraging Power BI, I transformed this rich dataset into meaningful visualizations to uncover trends and insights into air quality across states, cities, and counties.

## 💡 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
* Focused on four major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO).
* Analyzed metrics like mean pollutant levels, AQI, peak hours, and more.
* Mapped pollution trends across different states and cities, giving a clearer picture of how air quality varied geographically.

## 📌 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐈𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:
* Understanding historical pollution data is critical for crafting sustainable environmental policies and driving cleaner energy initiatives. 
* This project showcases how data visualization can make complex datasets accessible and actionable.

## 👨‍💻 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
* Power BI for building interactive dashboards.
* Data source: Kaggle's U.S. Pollution dataset (2006-2010).
